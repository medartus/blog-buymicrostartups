# How to Gather Feedback from Your Customers

Feedback is essential for any entrepreneur who wants to create a successful product. It helps you validate your idea, understand your customers’ needs, and improve your features. But how do you get feedback as soon as possible, without wasting time and resources?

In this article, I will share with you how we did it with our product, AI Alfred (now RecapioGPT), a tool that generates summaries from any text. I will also give you some tips and best practices on how to collect and use feedback effectively.

## Validate Your Idea with a Landing Page

The first step to get feedback is to validate your idea. You need to make sure that there is a demand for your product, and that people are willing to pay for it.

One of the easiest ways to do this is to create a simple landing page that explains your value proposition and asks for users’ email addresses. You can use a platform like Yep.so, which allows you to create landing pages in minutes, without coding.

We did this with AI Alfred, and we shared our landing page with relevant communities, such as Reddit, Hacker News, Product Hunt, and Facebook groups. We also used keywords related to our niche, such as “text summarization”, “AI writing”, and “content creation”, to optimize our page for search engines.

We collected over 500 emails from our first early adopters, who were interested in trying our product.

## Build a Basic MVP and Send It to Your Early Adopters

Once you have validated your idea, you need to build a basic MVP (minimum viable product) that delivers your core value proposition. You don’t need to have all the features or a perfect design, just enough to solve your customers’ main problem.

We built a basic MVP for AI Alfred, which allowed users to paste any text and get a summary in seconds. We used a pre-trained AI model from Hugging Face, which saved us a lot of time and effort.

We sent our MVP to our early adopters, and we asked them these questions:

- How many summaries/month do you need?
- What would you expect from this product?
- What pain points do you expect it is going to solve for you?
- How much would you pay for this solution?

These questions helped us understand our customers’ needs, preferences, and willingness to pay. We also asked them to rate our product on a scale of 1 to 10 and to share their feedback with us.

## Ask for Feedback After the First Trial and Iterate

After the first trial, we asked our early adopters for feedback about the product. We wanted to know what they liked and disliked, what they thought about the quality and accuracy of the summaries, and what features they wanted to see next.

We used a platform like Typeform, which allows you to create engaging and interactive surveys. We also offered incentives, such as free credits or discounts, to encourage users to complete the survey.

We analyzed the feedback and used it to improve our product. We added new features, such as customizing the length and tone of the summaries and supporting multiple languages. We also improved the quality and accuracy of the summaries by fine-tuning our AI model with more data and feedback.

We repeated this process of sending our product, asking for feedback, and iterating until we reached a product-market fit.

## Start Asking for Feedback from Day 0 and Keep in Touch with Your Customers

The key to getting feedback as soon as possible is to start asking for it from day 0. Don’t wait until you have a perfect product, or you will miss the opportunity to learn from your customers and validate your assumptions.

You should also keep in touch with your customers and communicate with them regularly. You can use platforms like Yep.so, which allows you to put a survey when users leave their email, and start asking for opinions even before the product is live. You can also use platforms like Intercom, which allows you to chat with your customers and send them updates, tips, and offers.

By getting feedback as soon as possible, you will be able to create a product that your customers love and that solves their problems. You will also be able to grow your business faster and achieve your goals.
