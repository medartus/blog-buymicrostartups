# How to attract the first users

When you’ve finally validated your idea (read how to validate your startup idea here: https://www.blog.buymicrostartups.com/docs/startup-creation/how-to-validate-a-startup-idea), you need to distribute it. We’re going to speak about communities, directories, and how you can attract the right attention to your product following our guide. We did it for all the products we launched. So let’s start!

## From validation to distribution

In this chaotic world. more chaotic in the SaaS market, we all must validate our ideas as soon as possible.

Once you’ve validated an idea, and you know there is a problem and a market, you need to attract your first users. I’m not speaking about paying customers, that’s a little bit different here. I’m speaking about users that can benefit from using your product.

In 2024 there is an activity that is more important than others: it is the **distribution**.

Everyone can build a product today. We’ve democratized everything about product building: there are no-code tools; there are AI tools for every activity like marketing, videos, and images. We are full of tools that can help us build our dream product in a few weeks (or days too).

So how to attract the first 100 users? How to attract the first 100 signups?

This is the strategy we adopted for each project we managed during the last couple of years.

## Promote your product on targeted websites

The first thing I always do when I’m ready to launch my product is look for good websites where I can boost my product. I mean directories, online communities, tools directories, groups, and so on. This is my list of websites and directories I always have on my laptop — if you have more, please comment!

1. https://news.ycombinator.com/
2. [http://fazier.com](https://t.co/JrAvaZpCL2)
3. producthunt.com
4. 1000.tools
5. uneed.best
6. insanelycooltools.com
7. makerpeak.com
8. getmakerlog.com
9. startups.fyi
10. betalist.com
11. indie.page
12. sideprojectors.com
13. startupstash.com
14. launchingnext.com
15. webwiki.com
16. betafy.co
17. prelaunchers.xyz
18. techpluto.com
19. startupranking.com
20. startuplister.com
21. startupinspire.com
22. 10words.io
23. pitchwall.co
24. owwly.com
25. Startupbase.io
26. launched.io
27. f6s.com

Note that most of them are directories with a long waiting list. So you could also have the option to pay to “skip the line”. I never did this, I just wait, but it depends on your plan.

## Promote your product on Reddit

Well, Reddit is an angel and a devil at the same time. The pain point with Reddit is that there are rigid rules about sharing, so you could be banned. You need to read very carefully the rules of each subreddit and then decide how to publish your post.

These are the subreddits I usually use:

1. https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/
2. https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/
3. https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/
4. https://www.reddit.com/r/EntrepreneurRideAlong/

## Promote your product on Facebook Groups

Promoting your product on Facebook Groups can be a great way to reach out to people who share similar interests. It’s important to keep in mind that Facebook Groups are communities of people who come together to discuss topics they care about. Therefore, it’s essential to approach them with respect and avoid spamming them with irrelevant content.

Here are some tips to help you promote your product on Facebook Groups:

1. **Find the right group**: Look for groups that are relevant to your product and have a large number of members. You can use Facebook’s search bar to find groups that match your interests.
2. **Join the group**: Once you find a group that you think is a good fit, join it. Make sure to read the group’s rules and guidelines before posting anything.
3. **Engage with the community**: Before promoting your product, engage with the community by commenting on posts and sharing your thoughts. This will help you build trust and establish yourself as a valuable member of the group.
4. **Promote your product**: Once you’ve established yourself as a member of the community, you can start promoting your product. Make sure to follow the group’s rules and guidelines when doing so. You can share your product’s features, benefits, and how it can help the members of the group.
5. **Measure your results:** Keep track of your results by monitoring the engagement on your posts. This will help you understand what works and what doesn’t, and adjust your strategy accordingly.
