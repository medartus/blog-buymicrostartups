# Tips to Buy or Sell

## Buy Your Micro-Startup

Whether you're a new or serial buyer, follow these tips for a successful micro-acquisition:

1. **Don't Send Money Before Verification:**

   - Set up video calls to verify data with the seller
   - Ensure that all backend data matches the listing

2. **Conduct Market Research:**

   - Define the target's market sector
   - Identify principal suppliers and customers
   - Evaluate market performance and the target company's position

3. **Focus on Important Metrics:**

   - Pay attention to metrics like MRR, Revenue, Profit, Multiple, Tech stack, etc.

4. **Make Your Offer:**

   - If the listing price doesn't align, make a counteroffer
   - Negotiation is part of the process

5. **Don't Be Afraid to Say No:**

   - If the offer conditions don't meet expectations, be willing to reject the product

6. **Do Your Homework:**
   - Prepare questions related to the business for a thorough evaluation

Taking these steps will enhance your chances of a successful micro-startup sale or acquisition.

## Sell Your Micro-Startup

Before you're ready to sell your micro-startup, be aware of the key numbers you should include in the listing stage:

1. **Basic Information:**

   - MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
   - TTM Revenue (Total Revenue from the last 12 months or since the beginning of your business if less than 12 months)
   - Total number of users (free + paid)
   - Number of paid users

2. **Churn Rate:**

   - Monthly churn rate calculation: (Customers lost in a month / Customers at the beginning of the month) \* 100

3. **Profit Margin:**

   - Net Profit Margin calculation: (Net Income / Total Revenue) \* 100
   - Higher net profit margin indicates a more efficient business

4. **Asking/Listing Price:**

   - Evaluate your micro-startup using the formula: MRR _ 12 _ Multiple (Multiple based on your field)
   - Common multiples used on platforms:
     a. SaaS: 2x-3x on TTM Revenue or 5x on TTM Profit
     b. Ecommerce: 1x-2x on TTM Revenue or 3x on TTM Profit
     c. Marketplace: 1x-3x on TTM Revenue
     d. Agency: 1x on TTM Revenue or 1x-3x on TTM Profit
