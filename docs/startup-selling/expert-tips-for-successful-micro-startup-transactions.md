# Expert Tips for Successful Micro-Startup Transactions

## Selling Your Micro-Startup: Maximize Value with Data

When preparing to sell your micro-startup, optimizing your listing with key metrics is crucial for attracting potential buyers. Follow these steps to create a compelling listing:

### 1. Provide Essential Information:

Ensure your listing includes vital details such as:

- **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)**
- **TTM Revenue (Total Revenue from the last 12 months or since inception)**
- **Total number of users (free + paid)**
- **Number of paid users**

### 2. Highlight Churn Rate:

Calculate and showcase your monthly churn rate to provide insights into customer retention:

- **Churn Rate = (Customers lost in a month / Customers at the beginning of the month) \* 100**

### 3. Showcase Profitability:

Demonstrate the efficiency of your business by presenting the net profit margin:

- **Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Total Revenue) \* 100**

### 4. Determine an Optimal Listing Price:

Utilize a proven formula to evaluate your micro-startup:

- **Listing Price = MRR \* 12 \* Multiple (Varies by industry)**

Consider common multiples used on platforms:

- a. **SaaS:** 2x-3x on TTM Revenue or 5x on TTM Profit
- b. **Ecommerce:** 1x-2x on TTM Revenue or 3x on TTM Profit
- c. **Marketplace:** 1x-3x on TTM Revenue
- d. **Agency:** 1x on TTM Revenue or 1x-3x on TTM Profit

Add value to your business by providing detailed information, and offer 1 to 3 months of post-sale support.

### 5. Leverage a Proven Platform:

List your micro-startup on a trusted platform to maximize exposure and attract potential buyers. We recommend [BuyMicroStartups](https://www.buymicrostartups.com/), a marketplace for buying and selling micro-startups.

### 7. Disclose private information safely:

Protect your business by sharing sensitive information only after the buyer signs a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). You can find a free template on your [listing page](https://www.buymicrostartups.com/marketplace/my-listings).

### 8. Secure Transactions with Escrow.com:

You should sign a Letter of Intent (LOI) with the buyer. LOI is a non-binding document that outlines the terms of the transaction. Yu can find a free template on your [listing page](https://www.buymicrostartups.com/marketplace/my-listings).

We recommend using [Escrow.com](https://www.escrow.com/) to ensure a secure transaction. Escrow.com is a licensed and regulated escrow service that protects buyers and sellers by holding funds in a secure trust account until the transaction is complete.

We recommend the following process:

1. **Agree to Terms:** Define terms with the buyer.
2. **Use Escrow.com:** Add transaction details to ensure a secure process.
3. **Buyer Pays Escrow.com:** Secure payment via wire transfer, credit card, PayPal, check, or money order.
4. **Verification and Shipping:** Escrow.com verifies payment, and the seller ships the merchandise.
5. **Buyer Accepts Merchandise:** Upon satisfaction, the buyer accepts the product.
6. **Payment to Seller:** Escrow.com pays the seller.
7. **Funds Release:** Escrow.com releases funds to the seller.

## Buying A Micro-Startup: Navigate the Acquisition Process

If you're considering a micro-acquisition, these tips will guide you through a successful transaction:

### 1. Verify Before Payment:

Prioritize verification by:

- **Setting up video calls to confirm data with the seller.**
- **Ensuring all backend data matches the listing.**

### 2. Conduct Comprehensive Market Research:

Invest time in understanding the market sector, principal suppliers, and customers, and evaluate market performance and the target company's position.

### 3. Focus on Key Metrics:

Pay close attention to essential metrics, including MRR, Revenue, Profit, Multiple, and the Tech stack.

### 4. Make a Strategic Offer:

If the listing price doesn't align with your expectations, engage in negotiations and be prepared to make a counteroffer.

### 5. Be Ready to Reject:

Don't hesitate to say no if the offer conditions do not meet your expectations.

### 6. Thorough Homework Pays Off:

Prepare a set of detailed questions related to the business for a comprehensive evaluation.

Following these expert tips will significantly enhance your chances of a successful micro-startup sale or acquisition.
